This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: accessing a vector element using an index that is out of bounds. The `get()` method on a vector will return an `Option`, which can be `Some` value if the index is valid, or `None` otherwise. This example uses `unwrap()`, causing a panic if the value is `None` which can lead to program crashes.  The solution file shows a safer approach using `if let`.
